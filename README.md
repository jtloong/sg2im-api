# Flask Microservice for Sg2im

This is a backend microservice that interfaces with the [sg2im-demo](https://github.com/jtloong/sg2im-demo). It accepts a scene graph in JSON over a POST request and returns a photorealistic image that is generated by the model.

## Local Deployment

First time running the project? Please do the following:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/jtloong/sg2im-api
cd sg2im-api
python3 -m venv env
```
From then on, if you want to launch the service on your computer just run `bash run.sh`
